## Covalent HPC Plugin

[Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz) is a Pythonic workflow tool used to execute tasks on advanced computing hardware. This executor plugin uses [PSI/J](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/index.html) to allow Covalent to seamlessly interface with a variety of common high-performance computing job schedulers and pilot systems (e.g. [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/), [PBS](https://www.openpbs.org/), [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/products/hpc-workload-management), [Flux](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Cobalt](https://git.cels.anl.gov/aig-public/cobalt), [RADICAL-Pilot](https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). For workflows to be deployable, users must have SSH access to the login node, access to the job scheduler, and write access to the remote filesystem.

## Installation

### Server Environment

To use this plugin with Covalent, simply install it using `pip` in whatever Python environment you use to run the Covalent server (your local machine by default):

```
pip install covalent-hpc-plugin
```

### HPC Environment

Additionally, on the remote machine(s) where you plan to execute Covalent workflows with this plugin, ensure that the remote Python environment has Covalent and PSI/J installed:

```
pip install covalent
pip install psij-python
```

Note that the Python major and minor version numbers on both the local and remote machines must match to ensure reliable (un)pickling of the various objects.

## Usage

### Default Configuration Parameters

By default, when you install the `covalent-hpc-plugin` and run `import covalent` for the first time, your Covalent [configuration file](https://docs.covalent.xyz/docs/user-documentation/how-to/customization/) (found at `~/.config/covalent/covalent.conf` by default) will automatically be updated to include the following sections. These are not all of the available parameters but are simply the default values.

```
[executors.hpc]
address = ""
username = ""
ssh_key_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
instance = "slurm"
launcher = "single"
inherit_environment = true
pre_launch_cmds = []
post_launch_cmds = []
shebang = "#!/bin/bash"
remote_python_exe = "python"
remote_workdir = "~/covalent-workdir"
create_unique_workdir = false
cache_dir = "~/.cache/covalent"
poll_freq = 60

[executors.hpc.environment]

[executors.hpc.resource_spec_kwargs]
node_count = 1
processes_per_node = 1
gpu_cores_per_process = 0

[executors.hpc.job_attributes_kwargs]
duration = 10
```

You can modify various parameters in the Covalent config file as-needed to better suit your needs, such as the `address` of the remote machine, the `username` to use when logging in, the `ssh_key_file` to use for authentication, the type of job scheduler (`instance`), and much more. Note that PSI/J is a common interface to many common job schedulers, so you only need to toggle the `instance` to switch between job schedulers.

A full description of the various input parameters are described in the docstrings of the `HPCExecutor` class, reproduced below:

https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/covalent-hpc-plugin/blob/996fc51263efd69624ba9bb73f8564d2083a5509/covalent_hpc_plugin/hpc.py#L117-L189

### Defining Resource Specifications and Job Attributes

Two of the most important sets of parameters are `resource_spec_kwargs` and `job_attributes_kwargs`, which used to specify the resources required for the job (e.g. number of nodes, number of processes per node, etc.) and the job attributes (e.g. duration, queue name, etc.), respectively.

1. `resource_spec_kwargs` is a dictionary of keyword arguments passed to PSI/J's [`ResourceSpecV1`](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/docs/v/0.9.0/.generated/psij.html#psij.resource_spec.ResourceSpecV1) class
2. `job_attributes_kwargs` is a dictionary of keyword arguments passed to PSI/J's [`JobAttributes`](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/docs/v/0.9.0/.generated/psij.html#psij.JobAttributes) class.

The allowed types are listed [here](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/covalent-hpc-plugin/blob/48611a9d7c5c51403ac69d4b446f35e7748bd479/covalent_hpc_plugin/hpc.py#L85-L111).

### Using the Plugin in a Workflow: Approach 1

With the configuration file appropriately set up, one can run a workflow on the HPC machine s follows:

```python
import covalent as ct

@ct.electron(executor="HPCExecutor")
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@ct.lattice
def workflow(a, b):
    return add(a, b)


dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(1, 2)
result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id)
```

### Using the Plugin in a Workflow: Approach 2

If you wish to modify the various parameters within your Python script rather than solely relying on the the Covalent configuration file, it is possible to do that as well by instantiating a custom instance of the `HPCExecutor` class. An example with some commonly used parameters is shown below. By defauly, any parameters not specified in the `HPCExecutor` will be inherited from the configuration file.

```python
import covalent as ct

executor = ct.executor.HPCExecutor(
    address="coolmachine.university.edu",
    username="UserName",
    ssh_key_file="~/.ssh/id_rsa",
    instance="slurm",
    remote_conda_env="myenv",
    environment={"HELLO": "WORLD"},
    resource_spec_kwargs={
        "node_count": 2,
        "processes_per_node": 24
    },
    job_attributes_kwargs={
        "duration": 30, # minutes
        "queue_name": "debug",
        "project_name": "AccountName",
    },
    launcher="single",
    remote_workdir="~/covalent-workdir",
)

@ct.electron(executor=executor)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@ct.lattice
def workflow(a, b):
    return add(a, b)


dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(1, 2)
result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id)
```

### Working Example: Perlmutter

The following is a minimal working example to submit a Covalent job on NERSC's [Perlmutter](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) machine. This example assumes you have an account named "UserName", a project named "ProjectName", and a Conda environment named `myenv` on Perlmutter with both Covalent and PSI/J installed. It also assumes that you have used the [sshproxy](https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/mfa/#sshproxy) utility to generate a certificate file in order to bypass the need for multi-factor authentication.

```python
import covalent as ct

executor = ct.executor.HPCExecutor(
    address="perlmutter-p1.nersc.gov",
    username="UserName",
    ssh_key_file="~/.ssh/nersc",
    cert_file="~/.ssh/nersc-cert.pub",
    remote_conda_env="myenv",
    job_attributes_kwargs={
        "project_name": "ProjectName",
        "custom_attributes": {"slurm.constraint": "cpu", "slurm.qos": "debug"},
    },
)

@ct.electron(executor=executor)
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

@ct.lattice
def workflow(a, b):
    return add(a, b)


dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(1, 2)
result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id)
```
